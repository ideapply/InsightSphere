## Manifesto

To reduce the pressure of individual information retrieval and verification, share ideas, experiences, and exchange perspectives and arguments, the following initiatives are proposed:

  - Establish a **Foundation Library** based on eliminating semantic redundancy with clear sources, a **Functional Library** based on planning ideas and practical experiences, and a **Discussion Library** based on viewpoints and arguments; all integrated into one graph, distinguished by three parent Tags: W (wiki), A (action), V (view).

    - For the wiki foundation library, content will be expanded gradually, initially including the following categories:

      - W/S: Establish a Topic-Based page for each software, serving as the parent Tag for that software
     
      - W/K: Pure academic classifications based on the Chinese Library Classification
        
      - W/AI: Temporary sub-items related to AI, including principles, applications (original creation and upper-level invocation), and sociological effects
        
    - For the functional library, it includes Topic-based concepts A/P and practical experiences A/A
      
    - For the discussion library, it mainly includes exchanges based on the content in A, and secondarily includes exchanges about the content in W
